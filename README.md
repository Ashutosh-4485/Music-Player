# Music-Player

It is GUI based application built using TKinter (Python) and other Python libraries. It contains some
basic features of a music app like add or delete a song, play, pause, next and previous song. Most of these
things were done using TKinter widgets but I had to use mutagen library to play the song and time library to
show the progress of the song and even time it.
